# Dungeon of Dread RPG

This is a passion project, as I am a huge nerd for all things D&D. So, to honor the great classics and polish my Python skills, I translated the concept of the "pick your own adventure" book "Dungeon of Dread" to Python code. Moreover, I converted the script into an executable file, which allows the game to run in any computer terminal. Source code of the .exe file is provided. Enjoy!
